Gideon is NOT AN AI ASSISTANT. It's just an intelligent asistant, programed and developed by Julian Principe. The developer (JP), is obsessed with AI (ML, DL,
and there respective areas. But this program is not a sample of that. Never than less, it's an amazing assistant, capable of telling jokes, giving the information
that you ask for, say "hello", telling things like the date, the previus date, math calculations, search and play the music you want, say "Good night", or "good morning", and all kind of human interactions. ItÂ¿s not even
a simple Machine Learning model, got nothing to do with AI, but, as i said before, it's got a lot of qualities, and i hope you like it. of you wish to add another quality, you have to look on the zone
that the capabilities are programed, (you will found it) and type : elif "whatever you wish to add" in rec:
                                                                       speak("whatever you want te receive")
And that's it. You have a very good assistant, at your service.
PD: for music playng you have to get a youtube api, you can do that by searching the Google extension "youtubev3", or something like that, and create a new api key, copy, and put that on the "keys.json" file, on the variable "youtube_key"
